The current version of the code is "alpha 1". It has not been not heavily tested but should be usable.

Here are the download links:
  * the [binary distribution](http://gwtphprpc.googlecode.com/files/phprpcgen_bin_alpha1.zip)
  * the [source distribution](http://gwtphprpc.googlecode.com/files/phprpcgen_src_alpha1.zip) (actually an export of an eclipse project, can be built with ANT)

Here is also the full [code of the tutorial](http://gwtphprpc.googlecode.com/files/TutorialCodeEclipseProject.zip).
